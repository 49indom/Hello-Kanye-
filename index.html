        <p><b>When I first listened to Waves, I didn't. After it said that "Turn it up!" thing in the beginning, I thought it was a weird anime thing. Now, I hate anime, so I just didn't listen to it. But later on in life, I thought I would give it a try, and boy, am I glad I did. WAVES IS SUCH A GOOD SONG! I don't even know how to describe it, It's so amazing.</b></p>
        <p><b>Just listened to 4th dimension. Now, that song is peak. Kids see ghost is way too forgoten, it's actually so wierd. Just, what they did with the sample in the beginning, it's just genius. I find that song constantly getting stuck in my head. If you haven't listen to hear, put it on as soon as possible. Shit will change you.</b></p>

    <p>This "blog" is dedicated to one of the most important and caring people in my life (I don't want to say your name online, but you know who you are). You've always been there for me whenever I've needed, and I know we always have our highs and lows, but I always know that I wouldn't be where I am without you. You're one of the smartest and coolest ðŸ˜Ž people I know. While I don't show it enough, I am so grateful to have you in my life, and I hope you never leave it. It's also dedicated to my goat Kanye West!</p>
