    <p>This "blog" is dedicated to one of the most important and caring people in my life (I don't want to say your name online, but you know who you are). You've always been there for me whenever I've need, and I know we always have our highs and lows, I always know that I wouldn't be were I was without you. You're one of the smartest and coolest ðŸ˜Ž people I know. While I don't show it enough, I am so grateful to have you in my life and I hope you never leave it. I also deteicate this to my goat Kanye West!</p>
